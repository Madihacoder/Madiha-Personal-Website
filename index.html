                <strong>A Passion for Medical Imaging and AI: Advancing Healthcare through Innovation</strong>
                <br>
                <br> My research is dedicated to revolutionizing healthcare through the application of advanced medical imaging techniques and artificial intelligence. My primary focus lies in the development and application of innovative methods for early disease detection, precise diagnosis, and effective prognosis.

                <br>
                <br> 
                My journey in this field was deeply influenced by personal experiences. Witnessing my mother's battle with Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder,taking about three years of treatment of being physically impaired , unable to speak because of diaelated false cords despite treated with Plasmapheresis due to damaged Mylein Sheath,  my Aunt battling stage 4 brain tumor despite chemo left bed ridden with just some months from the doctor to surive ignited my passion for finding innovative solutions to complex neurological and Cancerous challenges. Additionally, the widespread prevalence of cancer, especially in my region, has fueled my determination to contribute to early detection and improved outcomes.
